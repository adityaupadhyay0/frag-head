3️⃣ MVP Definition (Keep It Sharp)

If you try everything, you’ll drown.

Your MVP must answer ONE core question:

“What fragrance fits me right now?”

🧠 MVP Architecture
A. Intelligent Fragrance Engine (Core)
Inputs:

Occasion (date, interview, club, wedding, daily)

Outfit style (minimal, streetwear, formal, linen summer, etc.)

Mood/vibe (mysterious, dominant, soft, playful, intellectual)

Weather (hot humid, winter, AC office)

Gender expression (optional)

Budget range

Output:

3–5 fragrance suggestions

Visual scent graph

Emotional description

Outfit pairing suggestions

Longevity + projection insight

This is your main product.

B. “Vibe Engine” Instead of Chatbot

You said:

3D conversation yet not chatboty

Correct instinct.

Instead of chat:

✨ Interactive Orb Interface

8-bit magical aesthetic.

Floating pixel “scent core”.

User taps floating vibe options.

The interface morphs as choices narrow.

Sound design: soft retro sparkles.

No chat box.
More like selecting traits in a game.

Think:
Character creation screen for your scent identity.

C. Fragrance Data Layer

For MVP, don’t scrape aggressively.

You need:

Name

Brand

Top / Middle / Base notes

Accord categories

Season

Longevity

Sillage

Gender leaning

You can manually curate 200–300 popular fragrances first.

AI can:

Generate vibe interpretation

Convert notes → emotional language

Create outfit matching logic

D. Scent Visualization (Graph Layer)

This is where you differentiate.

Instead of boring pyramids:

1. Accord Radar Graph

Sweet

Fresh

Woody

Spicy

Smoky

Floral

Gourmand

Citrus

2. Mood Gradient Bar

Example:
Soft ←→ Dominant
Clean ←→ Dirty
Day ←→ Night

3. Projection Timeline

Animated 8-bit bar fading over hours.

Make it visual. Not text-heavy.

E. “Make Them Feel the Smell” Feature

You can’t transmit scent.
But you can simulate perception.

Use:

Cinematic micro-story

3–4 lines.

No cringe.

Make it atmospheric.

Texture mapping

Show fabric textures that match scent.

Linen = airy citrus.

Velvet = amber.

Leather = smoky oud.

Color Palette Mapping
Each scent → generated 5-color pixel palette.

This builds emotional sensory translation.

F. Mixed Feature (Advanced but Possible MVP-Lite)
“Layer Lab” (Mini version)

Let users:

Pick 2 fragrances

AI predicts outcome:

What notes dominate

What vibe emerges

Risk level (safe / experimental / chaotic)

This will make Frag-Head addictive.

4️⃣ Technical MVP Stack (Efficient Build)

Since you're technical:

Frontend:

Next.js

Three.js (light 3D orb only)

Tailwind (8-bit theme customization)

Framer Motion

Backend:

Supabase (you already like it)

OpenAI API for:

vibe generation

emotional mapping

layering simulation

Search:

Hybrid: vector similarity search

Convert user vibe into embedding

Match against fragrance embedding profiles

5️⃣ Magical 8-bit Design System

This is risky.

8-bit can look childish.
You need:

Rules:

Dark background (deep navy / near black)

Neon accent (electric lavender, cyan)

Pixel icons

Monospace display font

Soft glow animations

Avoid:

Overuse of pure rainbow colors.

Large chunky Minecraft UI blocks.

Think:
Retro arcade + luxury noir.
